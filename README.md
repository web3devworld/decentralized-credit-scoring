# Decentralized Credit Scoring System

A decentralized application (dApp) for managing and calculating credit scores using blockchain technology.

## Features
- User registration with wallet address.
- Off-chain data storage using IPFS.
- Credit scoring algorithm based on user-provided financial data.
- Transparent and immutable credit score records on the blockchain.

## Technologies Used
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum (or any EVM-compatible chain).
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity.
- **Frontend**: React.js.
- **Decentralized Storage**: IPFS.
- **Wallet Integration**: MetaMask.

## Project Structure
- `contracts/`: Contains Solidity smart contracts.
- `frontend/`: React frontend for interacting with the dApp.
- `scripts/`: Scripts for deploying and interacting with the smart contract.
- `test/`: Unit tests for smart contracts.
